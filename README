HTTP::Daemon::SSL is a descendant of HTTP::Daemon that uses SSL
sockets (via IO::Socket::SSL) instead of cleartext sockets.  It
also handles SSL-specific problems, such as dealing with HTTP
clients that attempt to connect to it without using SSL.

In order to use HTTP::Daemon::SSL, you need to have IO::Socket::SSL
v0.93 or newer installed as well as a recent version of libwww-perl.

installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
