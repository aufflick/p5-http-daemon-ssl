Quick note:

I have just taken over maintenance of HTTP::Daemon::SSL. This
developer release fixes a bug relating to accept() not timing out
( http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28417  ).

The todo list, in no particular order, is:

 * convert build system to Module::Build
 * change tests to use Test::More
 * improve test cases
 * update docs to reflect changes (include example of how to fix any
   code relying on the old behaviour).
 * fix remaining bugs lodged in rt.cpan.org:
   http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=HTTP-Daemon-SSL

-------

HTTP::Daemon::SSL is a descendant of HTTP::Daemon that uses SSL
sockets (via IO::Socket::SSL) instead of cleartext sockets.  It
also handles SSL-specific problems, such as dealing with HTTP
clients that attempt to connect to it without using SSL.

In order to use HTTP::Daemon::SSL, you need to have IO::Socket::SSL
v0.93 or newer installed as well as a recent version of libwww-perl.

installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
