Quick note:

I have just taken over maintenance of HTTP::Daemon::SSL. This
release fixes various bugs:
 * http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28417
 * http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=21395
 * http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=15470

The todo list, in no particular order, is:

 * convert build system to Module::Build
 * change tests to use Test::More
 * improve test cases

Latest versions are available on CPAN. My subversion repository is
also available:

  http://cvs.pumptheory.com/ (browse)

-------

HTTP::Daemon::SSL is a descendant of HTTP::Daemon that uses SSL
sockets (via IO::Socket::SSL) instead of cleartext sockets.  It
also handles SSL-specific problems, such as dealing with HTTP
clients that attempt to connect to it without using SSL.

In order to use HTTP::Daemon::SSL, you need to have IO::Socket::SSL
v0.93 or newer installed as well as a recent version of libwww-perl.

installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
